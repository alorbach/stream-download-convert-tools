Design an epic, visually striking album cover for: "{AI_COVER_NAME}"

Your cover art must:
- Capture bold emotion and grand scale—make it cinematic, iconic, and unforgettable.
- Channel the mood and distinct visual character of the musical style, elevating it to legendary status.
- Incorporate imaginative, dramatic, and awe-inspiring elements. Think big: sweeping scenery, dynamic lighting, expressive visuals, and visceral impact.
- Suggest a sense of timelessness, power, or wonder. It should stand out and feel worthy of a classic, platinum-selling album.

SPECIFICATIONS:
- Primary Style: {STYLE_DESCRIPTION} (This is the most important visual directive. Ensure the cover reflects this specific style above all else.)
- Underlying Mood: {MOOD_DESCRIPTION}
- Era/Tone: {VISUAL_TONE}
- Suggested Imagery: {SUGGESTED_VISUAL_ELEMENTS}
- Typography: {TYPOGRAPHY_STYLE}
- Layout: Dynamic, balanced composition inspired by legendary vinyl album covers, with centered, powerful text and visual focus. Create depth, drama, and an epic vibe within a square (1:1) frame.
- Format: High-resolution, suitable for streaming platforms.

TEXT TO DISPLAY ON COVER (in order of importance):
1. "AI COVER" - Prominently displayed at the top center in bold, distinctive typography
2. Song Title: "{SONG_TITLE}" - Large, prominent text below AI COVER label
3. Artist: "{ORIGINAL_ARTIST}" - Smaller but readable text below song title

The cover name "{AI_COVER_NAME}" provides context for the musical style transformation.

RULES:
- NEVER show or reference the original artist's face or any real person.
- NO clutter, NO incoherent elements, NO weak backgrounds—focus on impact and unity.
- Ensure "AI COVER" text is the most prominent element, clearly visible and readable.
- The AI COVER label must be stylized and eye-catching to indicate this is an AI-generated cover version.
- Output only the final descriptive prompt for image generation, nothing else.
